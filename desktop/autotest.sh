#                  Pure Node, mocks wsl.exe — no display/electron. Runs on Linux/macOS/Windows node.exe.
#   contract.js  — backend HTTP contract (CORS/OPTIONS/HEAD/auth/runtime-info; no token leak). Pure Node;
#                  runs on Linux/macOS/Windows node.exe. Locks in the dashboard-backend fixes.
#   verify.js    — renders the dashboard in headless chromium and asserts the intake + Settings UI.
#                  Needs the bundled playwright chromium (npm i --no-save playwright + a cached browser).
